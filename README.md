# custom-autoclicker
Autoclicker that you can customize. On the first window, the 1st box is for the amount of different
click locations you want to go between, and the 2nd is for the amount of times you want to loop 
those clicks (I did not implement a stop button, so don't make it too high). For the second window, 
first columnis the x coordinate, second is the y coordinate, third is the amount of times you want to 
repeat that click, fourth is a true/false for whether or not the click is a right click or not ("true"
means right click), and fifth is the wait time in milliseconds before the script moves on to the 
next location.
